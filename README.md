The Disaster Management System is a full-stack web app for early warnings, real-time alerts, and disaster recovery. It uses Java (Spring Boot) for the backend, SQL for data management, and JavaScript for API calls. The frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) provides an interactive UI that communicates with backend APIs.
